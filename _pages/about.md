I am Cyril, Research Engineer and Data scientist at MFGLabs Paris working on anomaly detection and LLM models.

Previously, I worked at [Thales](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/global/innovation/research-and-technology/) as Research Science Intern (Air traffic Optimization of CDG Airport and conflict resolution) and at [Skills4all](https://www.skills4all.com/) (classification and recommandation systems).


## Research Interests

My primary research focus lies in the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG), along with a keen interest in Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Understanding the potential risks and societal implications of Artificial Intelligence, I am committed to exploring ethical considerations within AI development. I consider the ethical facets as crucial components of responsible AI innovation. My belief is that anticipating and addressing ethical challenges is paramount for the responsible evolution of AI.

## Other Interests
I also enjoy doing some mathematics problems and I like the Number Theory.
In my leisure hours, I take pleasure in playing basketball and biking. I did some departemental French competition in Basketball (as a point guard).Beyond these active pursuits, I immerse myself in the world of literature by reading books in both Coptic and English. 

Moreover, I indulge in the art of cooking, finding joy in the creative process of preparing meals. This culinary passion not only serves as a delightful sensory experience but also allows me to experiment with flavors and techniques, adding yet another layer of creativity to my diverse set of interests.
